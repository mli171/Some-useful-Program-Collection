## Program Instruction: <br/>
1. del_dup_photos.R <br/>
The program is used for deleting the duplicated imported photos in your computer picture directory. 
Users must modify the working directory and the repeated sources in their photo filenames. <br/>

2. 3_d_matrix_value_check.R <br/>
The program only checks and compares values from a square matrix, which will produce a 3D plot. <br/>

3. AR_correlation matrix.R<br/>
Used for Formulation of AR-type correlation matrix. <br/>

4. ValueCheck.R<br/>
Used for checking the value in Score/Norm/Objective function values. <br/>

5. MatrixSquareRoot.R<br/>
Find the square root of a positive definite matrix for matrix standardization. <br/>

6. unique_permutation_index.R<br/>
Get the unique index from a completely random permutation or within a block permutation. <br/>

7. test_seasonality.R<br/>
To test seasonality exist in categorical time series by Shumay (2000)'s method in the book of "Time Series Analysis and its Applications with R Examples". <br/>
